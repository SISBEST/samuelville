          <p>Before Samuel signs off on a new law, it must be approved by the Legal Review Board (LRB). The LRB is elected every month, and consists of 10 members. The Board meets in the Government Theatre every day. Anybody can submit a legal idea. It goes straight to the Board. The Board then approves or denies the idea. If it is approved, it goes directly to Samuel. Samuel can then sign off on it, and if he does, it's a law.</p>
